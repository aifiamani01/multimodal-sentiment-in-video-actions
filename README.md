# Multimodal Emotion Recognition

## Motivation
Modern action recognition models achieve high accuracy, but it is unclear whether they encode affective or sentiment-related information.
Understanding this is important for human-centered AI and social perception.

## Core Question
Do pretrained video action recognition models implicitly encode sentiment?

## Initial Approach
I plan to probe frozen pretrained models using lightweight classifiers to analyze whether sentiment information is present in learned representations.

## Scope
This project focuses on analysis and understanding rather than achieving SOTA.

## Status
Literature review and experimental design.
